# MediFly Hospital App

## Overview
MediFly is a Flask-based web application simulating a hospital interface for managing air medical transport services. It streamlines patient transport coordination from intake to flight completion, featuring a multi-step form, enhanced provider comparison, booking confirmation, real-time flight tracking simulation, intelligent chatbot assistance with severity-based recommendations, and HIPAA-compliant administrative oversight. The project aims to provide an efficient, transparent, and scalable solution for medical transport logistics, incorporating a fairness system for provider quote distribution, a hybrid provider search, and a comprehensive commission accounting system. MediFly generates revenue through non-refundable deposits and a commission structure per booking.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
