## Key Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. All critical routes are responding correctly
2. Security headers are properly implemented
3. Database connectivity is stable  
4. Quote submission flow is functional
5. Admin and affiliate redirects work as expected (302 status)
6. Error handling is graceful with appropriate status codes

### ⚠️ Observations
1. Email and SMS services in fallback/logging mode (expected for dev environment)
2. Some admin routes redirect to login (expected security behavior)
3. Static asset serving working correctly

### 🔧 Recommendations
1. Configure email service for production deployment
2. Enable SMS service for production notifications
3. Monitor performance under load testing
4. Consider implementing caching for frequently accessed routes

## Next Steps
1. Run manual testing checklist from `tests/e2e_checklist.md`
2. Capture screenshots for documentation
3. Test email/SMS functionality with proper credentials
4. Perform load testing with multiple concurrent users
5. Validate all security measures are working as expected
