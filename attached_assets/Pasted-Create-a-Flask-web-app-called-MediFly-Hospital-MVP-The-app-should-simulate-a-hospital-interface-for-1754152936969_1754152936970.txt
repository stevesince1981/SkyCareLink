Create a Flask web app called MediFly Hospital MVP. The app should simulate a hospital interface for booking air medical transport with the following routes and views:

1. `/` (Landing Page)
- Hero text: “MediFly for Hospitals”
- Button: “Book a Critical Medical Flight” → links to `/intake`
- Footer disclaimer: “HIPAA-compliant demo. No PHI is stored.”

2. `/intake` (Guided Form AI-style)
- Create a multi-step guided form (in chatbot style) using Bootstrap cards.
- Questions in sequence:
  a) "Where is the patient currently located?"
  b) "Where are they being transported to?"
  c) "Select severity (1-5):" dropdown with tooltips for each severity level
  d) "What medical equipment is needed?" Checkboxes: Ventilator, ECMO, Incubator, Escort only, Oxygen, Other
  e) "When is the patient ready to depart?" Date input
- Submit button routes to `/results`
- Transient session: store input in `session` or temporary in-memory dict (no persistent database)
- Add a small alert: “Inputs used only for provider matching. Not stored.”

3. `/results` (Quote Options)
- Display 3 quote cards from mocked providers:
  - AirMed Response: $128,500, ETA: 3h, ICU Certified
  - REVA CriticalCare Jet: $112,000, ETA: 5h, Doctor onboard
  - MercyWings Global: $102,000, ETA: 6h, Basic evac
- Each card has “Select This Provider” → links to `/confirm` with provider ID

4. `/confirm` (Confirmation Page)
- Show selected provider details + patient info summary
- Add-ons section: Family Seat, VIP Cabin (checkboxes)
- Consent checkbox: “I authorize secure sharing of non-identifiable medical info”
- Button: “Finalize Booking” → route to `/tracking`

5. `/tracking` (Mock Flight Tracker)
- Show a progress bar (or stages: Dispatched, En Route, Arrived)
- Simulate timeline updates using session state (e.g., updates every refresh)
- Button: “Complete Flight” → goes to `/summary`

6. `/summary`
- Thank-you message
- Downloadable PDF stub link (just a button)
- Feedback input box: “How was the experience?” + Submit

Styling:
- Use Bootstrap 5
- Header with MediFly logo (text placeholder)
- Clean, professional layout suitable for hospital staff

Security:
- Use Flask `session` or temporary dicts
- Do not write any files or use a database
- Add HTTPS note: “All demo data is secure and not stored permanently”

Deploy using Replit hosting. Add `replit = "3.2"` to `pyproject.toml` if needed.
