ROLE: QA navigator, read-only verification in running app.

TASKS

Fan-out timer stub

Submit a new request via /intake.

On the quotes page, confirm you see:

Copy: “Quotes typically arrive within 15–60 minutes.”

A small cosmetic timer counting up.

Initial compact view

Confirm only 5 quotes show at first.

Check that the compact layout still matches previous styling.

“View 5 more”

Click View 5 more → confirm the next batch appears (if available).

Helper text “Up to a 2-hour delay…” is visible.

Fairness deprioritization

In /admin/affiliates, temporarily set one affiliate’s response_rate < 50%.

Submit another intake request → verify that affiliate still appears but slightly lower in the list.

Spotlight badge

In /admin/affiliates, mark an affiliate with < 50 bookings OR join_date < 90 days.

Submit request → verify Spotlight badge appears.

Zero-result compassionate state

Force test: temporarily disable all affiliates or filter results.

Submit request → confirm you see:

Warm message: “We’re sorry—no options yet…”

Yes/No opt-in for affiliate contact with third-party options.

Modify request & selection rules

From quotes page, click Modify request → prefilled form appears.

Save → verify a new version number (N+1) is generated; previous quotes retired.

Select a quote → affiliate name reveals; intake locks from edits.

Ground-included badge

Locate a quote with “Ground included” flag → hover shows tooltip.

Liability disclaimer

Confirm disclaimer text still displays directly under quotes list.
