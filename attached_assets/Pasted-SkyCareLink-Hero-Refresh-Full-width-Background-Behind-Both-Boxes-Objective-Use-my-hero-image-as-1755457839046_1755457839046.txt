SkyCareLink — Hero Refresh (Full-width Background Behind Both Boxes)
Objective

Use my hero image as a single full-row background that sits behind BOTH columns (left hero + right advisory).

Background should be faded (subtle, not washed out).

Background must match the current hero height/width—no cropping surprises, no mismatched bottoms.

Keep the “Request a Quote” button as the primary CTA.

Place the 4-step “How it works” block directly under the “Request a Quote” button (within the left content panel).

What to change (no code—actions only)

Move the image to the row-level background

Apply the hero image as the background of the entire hero row/section, not to either column/card.

Background position: center center; size: cover; repeat: no-repeat.

This ensures the image sits behind both boxes and scales cleanly.

Add a full-row fade overlay

Add one overlay layer that spans the entire hero row (same width/height as the row).

Opacity target: 22–28% black (start at ~25%).

The goal is “faded but still vivid,” not gray or muddy.

The two foreground cards (left hero panel + right advisory card) remain solid (white) so text stays crisp.

Lock the hero height consistently

Set a single min-height on the hero row so both columns naturally share the same height.

Desktop: 440–480 px (pick one; 460 px is a good default).

Mobile: 340–380 px (360 px is a good default).

Remove any competing min-heights on individual columns that cause mismatched bottoms.

Ensure bottom edges align perfectly

The bottom edge of the left and right panels must sit on the same baseline—no steps, no 1–2 px offsets.

If the right column grows taller, the row height must grow with it so the background and the left column expand together.

Place the 4-step block under the CTA

Inside the left content panel, keep the CTA row first.

Immediately below it, add the 4-step “How it works” explainer as a small, secondary block (light weight, small text).

Keep it single-column on mobile and compact on desktop (no heavy borders; subtle background if needed).

Maintain existing routes and branding

Primary CTA: /intake

Secondary CTA: /join_affiliate

Keep current SkyCareLink colors, icons, and typography.

Performance & assets

Use the provided hero image file; if it’s heavy, compress to ≤ 400 KB without visible degradation.

Enable lazy-loading only on below-the-fold images; hero should load immediately.
