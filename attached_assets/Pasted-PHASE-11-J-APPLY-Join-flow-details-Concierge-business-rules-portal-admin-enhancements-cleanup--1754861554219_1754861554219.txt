PHASE 11.J — APPLY: Join‑flow details, Concierge business rules, portal/admin enhancements, cleanup
ROLE: Senior product/dev lead. Implement your exact business requirements.

1) Join flows (Affiliate / Hospital / Individual)
/join_affiliate (enhance)
Hero copy: call out “Access the largest network of hospitals & clinics.”

Explain fees: “Flat $25,000 annual partner fee due at signup; your commission is 5%, with 1% of each booking credited back to your fee until you’ve recouped $25,000 (so effectively free once you’re flying).”

Company name:

Autocomplete from a curated “Top 50” list with add‑if‑not‑found.

Contact:

Business phone and mobile (mobile required for SMS alerts).

Address:

Google Places autocomplete + fill street/city/state/zip.

Commission %:

Locked to 5% in the UI (Admin can still adjust in Affiliates later; the Affiliate can’t).

Example explainer (callout card):

“Example: 10 flights at $25,000 = $2,500 gross commission. We credit 1% ($250/flight) toward your $25,000. After 100 such bookings, your credits reach $25,000 and your rate remains 5%.”

Delisting policy (short bullet list): unpaid fee, false licensing, service misrepresentation, SLA/quality failures; 2 strikes = lifetime ban.

Primary service areas: multi‑select (states/regions).

Niche markets: multi‑select from seeded Niches.

Available equipment: multi‑select (Ventilator, ECMO, Incubator, Escort, Oxygen, Other).

FAA Part 135 Certified:

Checkbox opens an attestation modal: exact legal text that they confirm Part 135 compliance, agree to immediate delist & forfeiture for misrepresentation, and agree to periodic re‑verification; must click Acknowledge to proceed.

Training: After submit, show “Onboarding & Training (1–2 weeks)” card and a “Load full‑function dummy data” button to practice with 30–50 sample cases.

/join_hospital (enhance)
Facility name: Google Places autocomplete; auto‑fills address fields.

Role: Supervisor / Team Member (Supervisor can invite/manage; Team Member cannot change org settings).

Referral program code: field at signup and editable later; validates that it belongs to another hospital/clinic.

Membership:

Free 1 year after launch; +1 year for every 5 referred orgs that join; free for life once any referral completes a flight.

After free period: $199.99/year, auto‑renew. 30‑day cancel: create background task to finalize on the right date; add countdown; offer 10% discount to stay.

Specialties (optional multi‑select), bed count (optional) — include but make them optional; they’re useful for future filtering.

/join_individual (new)
Add to the Join+ dropdown as “Individual”.

No fees initially.

Gate second booking with a paywall:

Choose: $99 one‑time fee or $9.99/mo with 1‑year minimum; 30‑day cancellation window at any time via portal.

Data:

No date of birth.

Phone numbers: allow 2, require one mobile.

Email required.

Marketing prefs:

“Send me updates” checkbox; ensure portal has email/SMS subscription management and unsubscribe works.

2) Concierge rules (finalize and clarify in UI)
Pre‑designated Concierge affiliate (admin flag).

Build the Concierge synthetic quote as:

Concierge price = best base quote + $15,000 (e.g., A=$25k ⇒ Concierge D=$40k).

Revenue split on add‑on: $7,500 us / $7,500 concierge affiliate.

1% payback: apply 1% credit toward $25k on base commission, and show a separate “Concierge credit” line (non‑commission) so affiliates see you’re helping them recoup faster.

UI:

Show Concierge badge (not Spotlight) with tooltip:
“Concierge add‑on available: +$15,000 premium support. Split $7,500 each. Base 5% applies to base fare only. 1% credit applies to base commissions; concierge credit applied separately to help you recoup faster.”

Confirm page shows: Base fare, Concierge add‑on, totals; commission shown only on base.

3) Admin: Affiliates list + edit fee %
Create /admin/affiliates (link in Admin nav) with table:

Name | Default % (read‑only) | Recoup progress ($ remaining to $25k) | Strikes | “Offers Concierge” | Actions: View / Edit

Edit view:

Admin can change commission_percent_default (3–7%) and toggle “Offers Concierge”.

Save triggers a ledger note for traceability.

4) Admin: Flights per Provider analytics (click to expand)
Page /admin/analytics/affiliates (link active).

Table with sorting + search:

Affiliate | Fee % | Recoup remaining | Flights (completed bookings) | Response rate (last 30 days) | Spotlight (yes/no) | expand (±)

Expand (±) shows flights list with per‑flight revenue, base fare, and (if applicable) concierge add‑on and splits.

Define Success Rate clearly in UI:

“% of quotes that converted to a booked flight in the last 30 days.”

5) Intake stepper polish
Confirm the pancake shrink animation is active (previous step compresses; click to jump back).

Severity = 1–3 with green/yellow/red chips and your tooltips.

Require login before submit fan‑out (but not to browse steps).

Ensure draft resume works silently; no extra toasts.

6) Home: “Why Choose MediFly?”
Add concise, confident blocks:

Largest network of hospitals/clinics & certified air operators.

Trust & compliance: Part 135 confirmations; periodic checks; immediate delist on misrepresentation.

Seamless ground (where available): “Ground ambulance to/from both sides included where available to ensure seamless handoffs.”

Fast & fair: Quotes 15–60 minutes; balanced distribution.

Privacy: minimal PHI; HIPAA‑minded.

7) Cleanup pass
Archive dated/duplicate templates and dead routes you no longer want.

Keep a single home, a single intake, and the new admin pages.
