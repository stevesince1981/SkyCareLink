PHASE 7.A — APPLY: Delist/Relist + Strikes, Announcements/Countdown, QA Hardening
ROLE: Senior engineer. Add operational controls and harden guardrails. No schema changes required if you’re using JSON; use /data/*.json if DB isn’t wired.

GOALS

Admin can delist/relist Affiliates with preset reasons, track strikes, enforce bans.

Co‑owners can post Announcements and a Countdown to Go‑Live banner.

Enforce final QA rules (delete vs cancel, modify limits, training caps).

TASKS

Delist/Relist + Strikes (Admin)

Admin screen: Delisted Affiliates table with filters.

Preset reasons dropdown (final list):

Unpaid affiliate fee/commission

False licensing attestation (Part 135)

Service misrepresentation

Quality/SLA failure

Other (notes required)

Actions:

Delist: set delisted_at, delist_reason, increment strikes.

Relist: requires fee flag (no payment wiring now), set relisted_at, clear delist flag.

Rules:

At 2 strikes → lifetime ban (cannot relist; $25k forfeit note shown).

Relist fee note: $25k fee; no 1% payback in year 1 after relist.

Announcements & Countdown

Admin → Announcements:

Fields: message, style (info|warn|success), start_at, end_at, optional countdown_target (ISO date).

UI: show a top banner site‑wide within start/end; if countdown_target present, show D‑day timer (“Go‑live in 12d:04h:29m”).

Dismissible per session.

QA Hardening

Delete vs Cancel:

Drafts: deletable.

Active requests with quotes: not deletable, only Cancelable with a reason; providers get notified (stub ok).

Modify limit:

Allowed only until a quote is selected (already implemented); show tooltip if locked.

Training caps & labels:

Enforce 50 dummy cases per Affiliate; show count used/remaining.

Ensure Dummy label shows on lists and never hits analytics or invoices.

Audit trail:

Record: delist/relist actions, cancel reasons, modify → version transitions, and selection events.

Outputs

Print paths/pages updated:

Admin > Delisted Affiliates, Admin > Announcements

Print the strike/ban logic summary:

“2 strikes → lifetime ban (forfeit note shown).”

Confirm delete/cancel/modify/training rules are now enforced.

End with READY FOR PHASE 7.B.
