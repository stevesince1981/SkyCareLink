PHASE 7.C — HOTFIX + UX POLISH (APPLY)
ROLE: Senior engineer. First diagnose & fix the /admin or /admin-dashboard 500, then implement the UX/content refinements you requested. Archive before edits. No schema changes.

PART A — Diagnose & fix the admin 500

Reproduce: hit /admin, /admin/, /admin-dashboard, /admin/dashboard.

Grab stack trace from server logs; print top 30 lines.

Auto‑fix common causes (one at a time; print what you did):

TemplateNotFound → point route to the existing admin template (prefer the newest “admin panel” we’re using), or create a minimal placeholder if missing.

KeyError/Undefined variable in Jinja → guard with defaults in the template or adjust the route context.

ImportError/NameError → fix import or rename to the actual function/file.

Re‑load the route and confirm non‑500 page renders. Print ADMIN DASHBOARD: PASS.

PART B — UX & copy refinements

Recoup/Commission copy (Affiliate portal):

New headline:
“You’re {pct_to_threshold}% of the way to your 5% commission.
${recouped} recouped of $25,000 — ${remaining} to go.”

Add celebratory state when threshold reached: “🎉 You’ve unlocked the full 5% commission rate on new bookings.”

Per‑quote breakdown row (on quotes/confirm and affiliate commissions detail):

Base fare

Gross (5%)

Effective commission (4% until threshold, else 5%)

1% credit applied to your $25k (only when at 4%)

Net due this booking

Ensure currency is formatted $XXX,XXX.XX.

Draft toast noise control (intake/requests):

Show “Draft saved” toast only on the first save per session (or when user returns to a draft).

Suppress repeated toasts on the 30s autosave; instead show a subtle inline “Saved • HH:MM:SS”.

Don’t show draft messages on non‑intake pages.

Countdown timezone & accuracy (Announcements):

Make countdown target run in EST (America/New_York).

Show DD:HH:MM and tick every second.

If target passed → switch banner to “We’re live!” state automatically.

Time preference (12h/24h):

Add a user setting: Time Format = 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour (military); default 12h.

Display times in the chosen format across intake, quotes, confirm, dashboards.

Where it helps, show dual format on hover tooltip.

Currency formatting (partner/affiliate dashboards):

Enforce two‑decimals USD formatting everywhere (totals, rows, invoices previews).

Fix any places showing integers or inconsistent commas.

Performance analytics definitions (+ feedback):

Define metrics visibly in tooltips:

Quote Response Time = time from request fan‑out to first quote received.

Fulfillment Time = time from booking confirmation to flight completion.

Add Post‑flight feedback (internal QA, not public reviews):

1–5 star rating, dropdown reasons (e.g., “Arrival delay”, “Bedside care”, “Ground transfer”, “Communication”), optional comments.

Display aggregate rating/trend to Admin and Affiliate only (no public profiles).

Titles removal in Affiliate dashboard:

Strip honorifics like “Captain”, “Dr.”, “Mr./Ms.” from display names in UI.

Keep full legal names in admin records; UI shows clean names only.

Copy check (“Affiliate” vs “Hospital/Clinic”):

Double‑check auth/login, headers, and any dashboard labels still saying “Provider”; fix to Affiliate (Air Operator) or Hospital/Clinic as appropriate.

OUTPUTS

Print: ADMIN DASHBOARD: PASS/FAIL and what was fixed.

List the files/pages updated for recoup copy, per‑quote breakdown, draft toast throttling, countdown TZ, time preference, currency formatting, feedback UI, and title stripping.

End with: READY FOR 7.D RUNTIME TEST.
