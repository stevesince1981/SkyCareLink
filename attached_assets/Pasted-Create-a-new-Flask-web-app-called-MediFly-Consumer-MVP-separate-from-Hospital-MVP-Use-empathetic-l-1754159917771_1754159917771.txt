Create a new Flask web app called MediFly Consumer MVP, separate from Hospital MVP. Use empathetic language, friendly interface, pastel styling. Mirror Hospital functionality but tailored to families. Add toggle on landing for "Family/Individual" (default) vs "Hospital/Insurance" (redirect to Hospital URL if separate, or route switch). Add top animation: CSS keyframes helicopter flying left-to-right, transitioning to plane/jet circling globe icon. Use Bootstrap 5, HIPAA demo (no stored data).

File Structure:





app.py: Main Flask app with route logic, toggle handling.



templates/: index.html (with toggle), intake.html, results.html, confirm.html, tracking.html, summary.html, base.html.



static/css/style.css: Pastel theme, animation keyframes.



static/js/main.js: Chatbot, form steps, tracking, toggle logic.



static/js/botui.min.js: BotUI CDN (https://unpkg.com/botui/build/botui.min.js).



static/img/helicopter.svg, plane.svg, globe.svg: Placeholder icons for animation.



pyproject.toml: flask, python-dotenv, replit = "3.2".
