PHASE 9.C — APPLY: Home vs Intake Routing (brand link → Home, intake → last‑night pancake)
Paste this into Replit AI

ROLE: Senior engineer. Restore real Home at /, point all “New Request” to /intake, and ensure /intake renders the last‑night pancake template. Archive before edits.

TASKS

Restore a real Home page at “/”

If we previously archived the old home:

Move /archive/templates/index_old.html back to templates/index.html

If no home exists, create templates/index.html (landing) with hero + CTAs:

Buttons: “New Request” → /intake, “Join as Affiliate” → /join_affiliate, “Join as Hospital/Clinic” → /join_hospital.

Make the last‑night pancake the ONLY intake

Ensure the actual pancake file is present (the one you restored last night):
consumer_templates/consumer_intake_updated.html

Route /intake to render that file exactly (no redirects to / anymore).

Add a temporary admin‑only debug label at the top of the intake template:
Template: consumer_intake_updated.html (last-night)

Fix the navbar brand link everywhere

In your active base layout(s) (e.g., consumer_templates/consumer_base.html):

Set the brand link to: href="{{ url_for('home') }}" or href="/" (whichever your app uses)

Ensure it does not point to /intake or a legacy route.

Route cleanup

Keep legacy request routes (e.g., /request, /consumer_index, /request_transport, /transport_request) as 301 → /intake (not to /).

Remove any redirect that sends /intake → /.

Link sweep

Update all “New Request” / “+ New Request” / “Start a request” links and JS redirects to point to /intake.

Leave the brand “MediFly” link pointing to /.

Archive leftovers

If a duplicate intake template exists (e.g., consumer_templates/index.html that was the pancake), move it to /archive/templates/intake/.

OUTPUT

Print:

HOME: "/" → templates/index.html

INTAKE: "/intake" → consumer_templates/consumer_intake_updated.html

NAV: brand link → "/" (home)

REDIRECTS: [/request, /consumer_index, /request_transport, /transport_request] → "/intake"

ARCHIVED: any duplicate intake templates

DEBUG: intake page shows "Template: consumer_intake_updated.html (last-night)" for admins
