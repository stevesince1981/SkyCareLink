SkyCareLink – Pancake Intake Form Modifications (Audit & Triple-Check)
General Rules:

Never auto-select defaults (unless explicitly stated).

Next buttons remain disabled until required inputs are completed.

All steps must allow clean navigation forward/backward without losing data.

If new request = no pre-filled data anywhere.

Each step should visually confirm readiness (highlighting Next when criteria are met).

Triple-check that form validation works in all cases (new, edit, resume).

Step 1: Service Type Selection

Remove auto-selection of “Critical Transport.”

User must manually choose from available service types.

Only after a choice is made: Next: Patient Severity button becomes enabled & highlighted.

Audit: Verify new requests start with no default service type selected.

Step 2: Patient Severity Level

Remove auto-selection of Level 2.

All severity options appear greyed-out until user selects one.

Required Medical Equipment boxes:

Resize smaller so the section fits into 3 rows maximum.

Only after a severity level is selected: Next: Location button enables & highlights.

Audit: Verify no severity or equipment is pre-selected in new requests.

Step 3: Location Details

If brand new request: all fields must be blank.

Reorder fields so that Flight Date appears at the top, immediately above From/To location.

Fields required for Next button to activate:

City/State for both origin & destination

Flight Date (mandatory)

Flight Time (mandatory)

Preferred Transport Time (mandatory)

Once all are filled: Next: Patient Info button enables & highlights.

Audit: Test fresh form = blank. Test returning form = prefilled only if user saved progress.

Step 4: Patient Information

Fields:

Contact Name (text area placeholder: “Your contact information”)

Relation to Patient (optional)

Contact Phone → REMOVE entirely

Gender / Age / Weight → all optional, displayed on a single row, with no defaults

Additional Medical Information (optional, multiline input)

Validation: Form should allow moving forward even if all optional fields are left blank (only Contact Name is required).

Once Contact Name is entered: Next: Review & Submit button enables & highlights.

Bug Fix: Ensure submission flow actually allows progressing to Review after all required info is complete.

Audit: Triple-check by testing both minimal form (only required fields) and full form (all optional filled).

✅ Final QA Checklist for Developers:

 No auto-selected defaults anywhere.

 Flight Date moved to top of Step 3.

 Equipment boxes resized (≤ 3 rows).

 All “Next” buttons properly tied to completion of required fields only.

 New requests = clean slate.

 Edit requests = correctly load saved values.

 “Review & Submit” stage works without blocking when requirements are met.
