PHASE 12.A — APPLY: Rebuild Intake “Pancake” + Quotes Logic + Anti‑abuse + Portal & Bot
ROLE: Senior engineer. Archive before edits. Replace the current intake with a brand‑new, 5‑step pancake flow exactly as specified. Also fix quotes/unmasking, concierge badge, dummy pricing, provider team oversight, request list spacing, and add a guided bot.

1) Brand‑new Intake Stepper (pancake) — exact UX
Route: /intake (canonical)

Steps & behavior

Service Select

“Type of transport”: Critical / Scheduled (industry standard wording)

Next → current panel shrinks (compressed “pancake”), next panel expands

Previous pancakes are clickable; jumping back preserves state

Patient Severity Level

Three large smooth buttons:

Level 1 — Stable Routine Care (Routine transfers, non‑urgent procedures)

Level 2 — Moderate — Monitoring Needed (Requires monitoring, some intervention)

Level 3 — Critical — Life Support (Ventilator, ECMO, critical interventions)

On select, auto‑suggest equipment for Levels 2–3 (user can unselect later)

Next → shrink pancake

Location

“Where do you need transport?”

From: hospital/clinic name + address (city/state)

To: same fields

Google Places autocomplete with “+ Can’t find it?” manual add; fills street/city/state/zip

Preferred Date & Time (dropdown timepicker)

Same‑day urgent checkbox → shows “+20% urgency” note; this surcharge must carry into quotes math

Next → shrink pancake

Patient Info

Patient name

Age band (Under 1, 1–12, 13–17, 18–64, 65+) — no DOB collected

Required medical equipment (if known) — multi‑select; auto‑preselected from severity; user can unselect

Additional medical information (textarea): helper text
“Diagnosis, special requirements, allergies, or other relevant medical information — do not include PII/PHI.”

Next → shrink pancake

Review & Submit

Read‑only review of all steps; acknowledge checkbox (“I confirm these details are accurate to the best of my knowledge.”)

Submit Request

If not logged in, intercept here → “Login or Create Account” (Individual / Hospital/Clinic / Affiliate)
Save the full draft; after successful auth, return to Review and allow submit.

Other

Quiet autosave on blur/step change; no toast spam.

Keyboard and mobile friendly; smooth animations.

Replace any “MVP” language; severity is 1–3 only.

2) Quotes page — Concierge + unmasking rules + dummy pricing band
Concierge badge (not “Spotlight”)

Show Concierge pill on synthetic concierge quote when at least one Concierge‑enabled affiliate exists.

Price = best base fare + $15,000; badge tooltip explains split ($7.5k / $7.5k) and that base 5% applies only to base fare; 1% recoup credit applies to base commission + show separate concierge credit line for transparency in dashboards.

Dummy pricing band

For training/dummy quotes, constrain totals to $20,000–$72,000 (before same‑day +20%).

Unmask AFTER affiliate confirms

Selection dialog changes to:
“Request Affiliate 2** for your transport?** A booking code will be issued to you and the affiliate. Your request will be sent for confirmation. Provider identity remains hidden until affiliate confirms with partial or full payment.”

On Select:

Generate a Quote Code (short alphanumeric).

Send code to the user via email/SMS and to the affiliate (stubbed now).

Lock intake edits.

Affiliate portal gets a “Confirm Booking” button for pending selections; on confirm:

We unmask provider to the user and move to confirmation/payment instructions.

Same‑day +20%

If same‑day box checked in intake, add +20% to quote totals; display the surcharge as a line item.

3) Anti‑abuse & fair‑use policy
Rate‑limit:

Per IP: 5 requests/hour (configurable).

Per account: 3 “no‑booking” quote rounds allowed in any rolling 14 days; on the 4th, require a $49 refundable deposit (refunded on any booking within 30 days).

CAPTCHA on submit for logged‑out users (turns off after account creation/MFA).

Blacklist/denylist:

Maintain an AbuseFlags table with IP/device fingerprint/email; auto‑escalate on rapid repeats; hard block after clear abuse. Admin can unban.

Copy: Add a short fair‑use note beneath Submit: “To keep the network responsive for real patients, excessive quote‑only activity may require a small refundable deposit.”

4) Requests screen — tighter rows & “New Quote” indicator
Make “Previous Requests” compact (denser than default table, still touch‑friendly).

Keep elapsed timer for pending.

Show “New quote available” badge on polling (15s). Clear on view.

5) Provider (Affiliate) portal — team oversight
Affiliates can invite/approve team members.

Role = Owner (full) / Team Member (quote & case work, no financials).

Team sees all org requests; owner can reassign cases across members.

6) AI Support Assistant (guided Q&A)
Add chat launcher (“Hi—how can I help? Are you an Affiliate, Hospital/Clinic, or Individual?”).

Pre‑built FAQs per role (industry standard language), e.g.:

Affiliate: “How do commissions work (5% with 1% credit)?”, “Concierge add‑on?”, “Delist rules”, “How do I confirm a booking?”, “How is same‑day priced?”, “How to toggle training data?”

Hospital/Clinic: “How fast do quotes arrive?”, “Ground included where available?”, “How do referrals work?”, “Free year and extension rules?”, “What info is required?”

Individual: “What’s the process?”, “Fees for second booking?”, “How to cancel subscription?”, “What data do you store?”

The bot presents buttons for common intents and expands answers inline; escalates to contact if needed.
