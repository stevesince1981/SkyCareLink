SkyCareLink — Hero Image Corrections (No Code, Exact Actions)
Objective

Make the left hero image (plane + crew) look professional: not cropped, slightly dimmed, and exactly the same height as the right advisory card—on desktop and mobile. Keep the CTA + 4-step “How it works” panel under the button.

Files/Areas to touch (no code here—just where to work)

Homepage hero section in your main template (where the image + “Request a Quote” live).

The small CSS file you’re already using for hero tweaks.

The image asset: static/img/skycarelink_Front.png (leave the filename as-is).

Step-by-step changes (what to do)

Switch the image handling to avoid cropping

Use the image as an <img> element inside the left hero container, not as a CSS background.

Set it so it fills the width and height of the left hero area without obvious cropping.

Focal point: keep the plane nose and crew visible (center slightly above midpoint).

Target frame: approximately 50% (horizontal), 40% (vertical) so faces/plane aren’t cut off.

Add a subtle dimmer (do not over-darken)

Apply a soft black overlay on top of the image at 25–35% opacity across the full image area.

Keep your existing semi-transparent white panel behind the text/buttons so the copy is crisp.

The panel should remain around 70–75% white opacity (not more).

Force equal column heights

The left image column and the right advisory card must be exactly the same height.

Do this by:

Making the hero row stretch both columns to equal height, and

Applying the same minimum height to both columns:

Desktop: 420–460 px target (choose one; use the same on both sides).

Mobile: 320–360 px target (again, same on both sides).

Ensure the bottom edges align perfectly (no step as shown by the red underline in your screenshot).

Prevent “short box” on the left

The left image container must expand to match the right card’s height even if the image is shorter.

The image should scale up to fill the vertical space while keeping the focal point (plane + crew) intact.

Keep the hero text legible but not floating

Keep the text/button box centered horizontally on desktop; centered on mobile.

Leave comfortable padding around it so the crew faces aren’t blocked by the box.

Maintain the CTA, then directly under it, the small 4-step “How it works” panel (same visual style you added earlier).

Spacing + edges

No gutter gap between the two columns at desktop (or keep a very thin one, but both columns must still align at the bottom).

Ensure the right card’s outer drop shadow remains subtle; match the left overlay panel’s shadow.

Performance

Compress the PNG if it’s large. Aim for ≤ 300–400 KB without visible degradation.

Ensure lazy loading is ON for the image on mobile.

Acceptance criteria (what QA must confirm)

Layout & alignment

 The bottom edges of the left image area and right advisory card are exactly aligned (no 1–2px mismatch).

 On desktop, both columns are the same height (420–460 px); on mobile, both are the same (320–360 px).

 The left column never becomes shorter than the right.

Image quality

 The plane and crew are fully visible—no heads cut off; the plane’s nose is not cropped out.

 The image is slightly dimmed (25–35% overlay) but remains vivid; not washed out.

Text legibility

 The hero text remains high-contrast and readable in all screen sizes.

 The CTA is the primary visual element in the left panel.

 The 4-step explainer appears directly beneath the CTA in a small, subtle block.

Responsiveness

 On mobile, columns stack; the image still looks correct (no severe cropping), and the text panel doesn’t overlap faces.

 On tablet widths, the composition still shows plane + crew clearly.

Performance

 The image loads quickly (no jank); Lighthouse shows efficient image usage for the hero.

Visual tuning knobs (if it still doesn’t “feel right”)

If the image looks too bright → increase overlay from 25% to 30–35%.

If the image feels too muted → reduce overlay to 20–22%.

If faces get cut off on some screens → adjust focal point upward slightly (vertical ~35–38%).

If the left still runs shorter than the right on tall content → increase the left min-height to match the right’s tallest case (typically 460 px on desktop).
