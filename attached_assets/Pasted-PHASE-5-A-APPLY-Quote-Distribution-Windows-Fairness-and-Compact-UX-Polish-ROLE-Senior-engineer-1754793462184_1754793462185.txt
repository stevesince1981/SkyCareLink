PHASE 5.A — APPLY: Quote Distribution Windows, Fairness, and Compact UX Polish
ROLE: Senior engineer. Tighten quoting behavior and the compact results list. No schema changes.

GOALS

Requests fan out to eligible Affiliates fast.

Results appear in a 15–60 min window, with a visible “View 5 more” control.

Fairness: track low responders, rotate/balance requests.

Compassionate zero‑result flow & affiliate‑assist opt‑in.

Modify request stays enabled until selection; selection unblinds the chosen Affiliate.

RULES

Archive before edits.

Keep compact quotes layout (3–5 visible rows).

No payment/escrow changes.

TASKS

Fan‑out timing stub

On intake submit, enqueue anonymized requests to eligible Affiliates.

Surface UI copy: “Quotes typically arrive within 15–60 minutes.”

Add a small timer on the quotes page (“Waiting for responses… 00:30, 01:00…”) purely cosmetic.

“View 5 more” behavior

Default show max 5 rows; clicking View 5 more appends up to 5 additional results if available.

Show helper text: “Up to a 2‑hour delay in saturated markets.”

Fairness & spotlight

Track response‑rate % per Affiliate (rolling 30 days).

If an Affiliate’s response rate <50%, deprioritize them one slot in rotation (don’t block them entirely).

Spotlight badge remains for Affiliates with <50 bookings or <90 days since join (whichever comes first).

Zero‑result compassionate state

If zero quotes after a short wait:

Show a warm message: “We’re sorry—no options yet. You can modify your request or we’ll keep checking.”

Provide Yes/No opt‑in: “Would you like an Affiliate to contact you with third‑party options? Note: May not include Part 135 or guaranteed service.”

Modify & selection rules

Modify request: enabled until a quote is selected; opens with prefilled data; saving creates Version N+1 and retires N’s pending quotes.

Select & Reveal: reveals the chosen Affiliate name and locks the intake from further edits.

Ground‑included clarity

Preserve the small “Ground included (where available)” badge on rows that offer it.

Add a one‑line tooltip on hover: “Provider indicates ground transfer support on both ends when available.”

Legal copy

Keep the liability disclaimer directly under the quotes list (already added earlier).

OUTPUTS

Print what changed (files touched, components updated).

Confirm: default shows 5 quotes; “View 5 more” appends; fairness logic active; compassionate zero‑result state visible; modify/selection rules enforced.

End with READY FOR PHASE 5.B.
