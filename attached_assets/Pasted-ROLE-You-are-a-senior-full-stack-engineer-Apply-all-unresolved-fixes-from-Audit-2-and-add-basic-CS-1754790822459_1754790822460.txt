ROLE: You are a senior full‑stack engineer. Apply all unresolved fixes from Audit 2 and add basic CSS so banners/tags render correctly. Make a short PASS/FAIL summary at the end.

STRICT RULES

Archive, don’t delete. Use /archive/... (not /archieve).

Keep only one active launcher in root: main.py that imports consumer_main_final.py.

Don’t change DB schemas in this pass.

If a file path doesn’t exist, create it.

1) ENTRYPOINTS CLEANUP
Move these from project root → /archive/entrypoints/ if they still exist there:

consumer_main.py, consumer_main_updated.py, consumer_app.py, consumer_app_updated.py, app.py

If any files are under the misspelled /archieve/..., move the entire tree to /archive/... keeping structure, then remove the empty /archieve/ folder.

2) TERMINOLOGY FIXES (UI TEXT ONLY)
In consumer_main_final.py update air-operator role/labels at lines flagged in Audit 2:

20, 455, 461, 507, 523, 528, 534, 711–712 → change “provider/Provider” to “affiliate/Affiliate” where the context is the air operator role.

In templates under /templates/ and /consumer_templates/: replace visible role labels “Provider” → “Affiliate” where it refers to air operators. If a “Provider” label actually means the requester, change to “Hospital/Clinic”.

In JS under /static/ and /consumer_static/: update any UI labels/messages that show “Provider” to “Affiliate” (role context only).

3) LIABILITY DISCLAIMER (FOUR SCREENS)
Insert the exact text below in these places (if missing):

sql
Copy
Edit
MediFly aggregates requests and quotes. Affiliates are solely responsible for licensing, safety, availability, and service delivery. Availability and pricing are not guaranteed.
Intake page(s): all consumer_templates/consumer_intake*.html — add near the submit area (before the button), wrapped in a <div class="disclaimer">…</div>.

Quotes: keep if already present in consumer_templates/consumer_quotes_enhanced.html. If not, add immediately below the compact list container.

Confirm: all consumer_templates/consumer_confirm*.html — add near the top of the summary card.

Footer/Base: consumer_templates/consumer_base.html (or your base layout) — add in the footer area in small text.

4) JOIN ROUTES & NAV
In consumer_main_final.py add minimal routes if missing:

less
Copy
Edit
@consumer_app.route('/join_affiliate')
def join_affiliate(): return render_template('join_affiliate.html')

@consumer_app.route('/join_hospital')
def join_hospital(): return render_template('join_hospital.html')
Create placeholder templates if they don’t exist:

consumer_templates/join_affiliate.html → heading “Join as Affiliate (Air Operator)”

consumer_templates/join_hospital.html → heading “Join as Hospital/Clinic”

Add a one‑line note: “Signup form TBD.”

Add nav links in the base layout (header menu) pointing to /join_affiliate and /join_hospital.

5) TRAINING/DUMMY MODE VISUALS
In your base layout (consumer_templates/consumer_base.html or equivalent), add a site-wide banner that shows when training is active. Use the session flag if present; otherwise use any existing training flag you implemented:

html
Copy
Edit
{% if session.get('training_mode') %}
  <div class="training-banner">TRAINING MODE — DUMMY DATA</div>
{% endif %}
In all list templates that render requests/quotes/bookings (e.g., quotes list, requests dashboard):

When an item is dummy/training data, show a small <span class="dummy-tag">Dummy</span> next to the title/label.

6) DRAFT UX VISUALS
In lists where requests appear, show a Draft badge when the request is a draft:

html
Copy
Edit
{% if request_obj.is_draft %}
  <span class="badge-draft">Draft</span>
{% endif %}
Ensure the “Modify request” control is visible before any quote is selected. It must reload the stored draft values (locations, severity, niches, ground, date/time, notes). If a quote has been selected, disable with tooltip text: “Editing disabled after selection; start a new request.”

7) COMPACT QUOTES LAYOUT ENFORCEMENT (VISUAL)
Ensure the quotes screen shows 3–5 rows by default with a simple “View 5 more” button below the list (no giant cards).

Each row should include, left→right: blinded Affiliate name + badges, price/ETA in the middle, actions (Select & Reveal, Compare) on the right.

Keep the liability disclaimer directly under the list.

8) CSS: ADD/UPDATE STYLES
Ensure a primary CSS file exists (/consumer_static/css/main.css or /static/css/style.css). If neither exists, create /consumer_static/css/main.css.

Add/update the following CSS rules (append if the file exists):

css
Copy
Edit
/* Training banner */
.training-banner{
  position: sticky; top:0; z-index: 1030;
  width: 100%;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  text-align: center;
  background: #f1f1f1;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
  font-weight: 600;
  letter-spacing: .5px;
}

/* Dummy tags */
.dummy-tag{
  display:inline-block;
  font-size: 11px;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  border: 1px solid #bbb;
  border-radius: 10px;
  color:#555;
  background:#fafafa;
  margin-left: 6px;
}

/* Draft badge */
.badge-draft{
  display:inline-block;
  font-size: 11px;
  padding: 2px 6px;
  border-radius: 10px;
  color:#6c4a00;
  background:#fff2cc;
  border: 1px solid #f3d27a;
  margin-left: 6px;
}

/* Liability disclaimer block */
.disclaimer{
  margin-top: 8px;
  font-size: 12px;
  color:#6c757d;
}

/* Compact quotes list spacing */
.quotes-compact .quote-row{
  display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:space-between;
  gap: 12px; padding: 10px 12px; border:1px solid #eee; border-radius:8px;
  margin-bottom: 8px; background:#fff;
}
.quotes-compact .quote-price{ font-weight:700; font-size: 18px; }
.quotes-compact .quote-actions button{ margin-left:8px; }
Make sure this CSS file is linked in your base layout (consumer_base.html or equivalent), e.g.:

html
Copy
Edit
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='consumer_static/css/main.css') }}">
If your static root differs, adjust the path so the browser can load the file.

9) FINAL VERIFICATION OUTPUT
After applying, print a concise summary with:

ENTRYPOINTS: list of root files kept and list of files moved to /archive/entrypoints/

TERMINOLOGY: number of occurrences updated (py/html/js)

LIABILITY: PASS/FAIL per screen with file paths

TRAINING VISUALS: PASS/FAIL + file paths where banner/tag are present

JOIN ROUTES: PASS/FAIL + file paths of routes and nav links

DRAFT UX: PASS/FAIL + file paths where “Draft” badge and “Modify request” appear

CSS: which file was updated/created and confirmation that it’s linked in base layout

End with READY FOR PHASE 3 if no blocking FAIL remains.
