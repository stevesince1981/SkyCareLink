# MediFly Consumer MVP Debug Summary

## Root Cause Analysis
The deployment issues were caused by:

1. **Main Import Issue**: main.py was importing old consumer_app.py instead of consumer_app_updated.py with all enhanced features
2. **Template URL Routing**: consumer_base.html had broken URL references to non-existent endpoints ('landing', 'consumer_static')
3. **Static File Path Issues**: Static file routing wasn't properly configured for consumer_static folder
4. **Template Inheritance Problems**: Multiple template errors preventing proper rendering

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### Fixed Issues âœ“
1. **Import Routing**: Updated main.py to import from consumer_app_updated
2. **Static File Configuration**: Added static_url_path='/consumer_static' to Flask app
3. **Template URLs**: Fixed static file references in consumer_base.html
4. **Syntax Errors**: Fixed string literal issues in consumer_app_updated.py
5. **Navigation Links**: Updated navbar URLs to use correct endpoints

### Remaining Issues ðŸ”„
1. **Template Navigation**: Still has 'landing' endpoint references causing BuildError
2. **Application Startup**: Consumer MVP not fully loading due to template errors
